## Overview
This is an R Markdown document that explains all the steps taken to analyze, clean and visualize a company's bike share data with the goal to convert a number of casual riders to annual members in order to improve the profitability of the business. 

### Prior Steps taken before analyzing on R Studio
A larger dataset was pre-cleaned and sorted using SQL before importing into R Studio for further analysis. This was done in order to filter our irrelevant data for easier analysis on R Studio.  

### Installing all necessary packages
```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("lubridate")
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

### Loading packages
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
```



### Aliasing dataframes
```{r}
X2021_06 <- read_csv("2021_06_sum.csv")
X2021_07 <- read_csv("2021_07_sum.csv")
X2021_08 <- read_csv("2021_08_sum.csv")
X2021_09 <- read_csv("2021_09_sum.csv")
X2021_10 <- read_csv("2021_10_sum.csv")
X2021_11 <- read_csv("2021_11_sum.csv")
X2021_12 <- read_csv("2021_12_sum.csv")
X2022_01 <- read_csv("2022_01_sum.csv")
X2022_02 <- read_csv("2022_02_sum.csv")
X2022_03 <- read_csv("2022_03_sum.csv")
X2022_04 <- read_csv("2022_04_sum.csv")
X2022_05 <- read_csv("2022_05_sum.csv")
X2022_06 <- read_csv("2022_06_sum.csv")
```

### Combining all dataframe into a single dataframe(all_trips)
```{r}
all_trips <- bind_rows(X2021_06, X2021_07, X2021_08, 
                       X2021_09, X2021_10, X2021_11, 
                       X2021_12, X2022_01, X2022_01, 
                       X2022_02, X2022_03, X2022_04, 
                       X2022_05, X2022_06)
```

### Checking out the new dataframe(all_trips)
```{r}
str(all_trips)

```

### Creating a new dataframe(all_tripsv2) to be visualized
```{r}
all_tripsv2 <- all_trips %>% 
  group_by(rideable_type, 
           member_casual, 
           day_of_week) %>% 
  summarize(num_of_rides = sum(num_of_rides), 
            Avg_min_per_rides = mean(Avg_min_per_rides))
```

### Checking out the new dataframe(all_tripsv2)
```{r}
str(all_tripsv2)

```

### Renaming the column names of the the new dataframe(all_tripsv2)
```{r}
all_tripsv2 <- rename(all_tripsv2, 
                      bike_type = rideable_type, 
                      membership = member_casual, 
                      total_rides = num_of_rides)
```

### Checking out the new column names
```{r}
colnames(all_tripsv2)
```

### Filtering out irrelevant datasets and assigning to a new dataframe(all_tripsv3)
```{r}
all_tripsv3 <- subset(all_tripsv2, bike_type != "docked_bike")
```

### Re-Ordering data
```{r}
all_tripsv2$day_of_week <- ordered(all_tripsv2$day_of_week, levels=c(
  "Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"))

all_tripsv3$day_of_week <- ordered(all_tripsv3$day_of_week, levels=c(
  "Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"))
```

### Visualization 1: Average minutes per ride for each type of bikes for each membership type
```{r}
ggplot(data=all_tripsv2) +
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x = day_of_week, 
                         y = Avg_min_per_rides,
                         color = membership, 
                         shape = bike_type,
                         size = Avg_min_per_rides))+
  labs(title = "Classic Bike Vs Electric Bike Vs Docked Bikes", 
       caption= "Data: June 2021 - June 2022", 
       x= "Day of Week", 
       y= "Average Minutes per Ride")
```

### Visualization 2: Total number of rides per bike type for each membership type
```{r}
all_tripsv2 %>% 
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x =bike_type, y = total_rides, fill = membership)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") + 
  labs(title = "Classic Bike Vs Electric Bike Vs Docked Bikes", 
       caption= "Data: June 2021 - June 2022", 
       x= "Bike Type", 
       y= "Total Number Of Rides")
```

### Visualization 3: Electric Bikes Vs Classic Bikes (Average minutes per ride)
```{r}
ggplot(data=all_tripsv3) +
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x = day_of_week, 
                         y = Avg_min_per_rides,
                         color = membership, 
                         shape = bike_type,
                         size = Avg_min_per_rides))+
  labs(title = "Classic Bike Vs Electric Bike", 
       caption= "Data: June 2021 - June 2022", 
       x= "Day of Week", 
       y= "Average Minutes per Ride")

```

### Visualization 4: Average minutes per ride per day for each membership type
```{r}
all_tripsv3 %>% 
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x =day_of_week, y = Avg_min_per_rides, fill = membership)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") + 
  labs(title = "Average Minutes per Ride per Day", 
        caption= "Data: June 2021 - June 2022", 
        x= "Days Of Week", 
        y= "Average Minutes per Ride")
```

### Saving Visualization to working directory
```{r}
ggsave("Bike Data Viz 6.png", width=10, height=5)
```

### Saving dataframes as CSV file
```{r}
write.csv(all_tripsv2,
          file = "Bike data viz.csv",
          row.names = FALSE)
```
